- Channel = Roleboard

- User must have the capability to format an entry however he wants

- It is then inserted into any roleboard/channel desired

- ENTRY
	- role (if role doesnt exist, create a new one)
	- message
	- roleboard (if channel does not exist, ask which channel to use as the roleboard)
	- reaction
	- channel (if left blank, new channel is created with same name as role name. if channel does not exist, create a new channel. if channel exists, associate entry with the channel)

- Take note that using on_reaction_add utilizes the message cache. Could use a get_message poll as a solution
