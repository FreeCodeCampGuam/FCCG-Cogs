# FCCG-Cogs

Quality cogs from the lovely members of Free Code Camp Guam


Aside from regular cogs made by the FCCG members, this repo will also contain utility and learning-based cogs that we end up making to help us with organinzing and facilitating our communications and events at FCCG


What's a cog? A group of functionalities for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot).
