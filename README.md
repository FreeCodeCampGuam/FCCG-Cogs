# Community Repl

### for a bot hosted on a server/pi with minimal cogs.  
* Repl available for everyone to use.  
* "Logging in" to people's repls.  
* Giving permission for someone to use a repl.  
* Manually Stopping execution of a repl.
* Time out repl if blocking/infinite loop?
* Save/load repls. Save every line of input in each session's file before exec, command to load and name repl sessions.  
* Put repl contents up on repl.it or similar? I think there was one where you could pass in the code in the URL
